HackMIT 2013

Digital Beat gamifies your daily exercises by sharing your personal health fitness data with others. The Polar T34 heart rate monitor wirelessly feeds your heart rate to the Arduino attached to the T-shirt, which then creates visualizations on the LED matrix depending on the user's performance level. DigitalBeat is also interfaced with a BlueSMiRF Silver Bluetooth module, so that the users can set their customized goals through their Android device.
